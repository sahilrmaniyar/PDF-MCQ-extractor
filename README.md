# PDF-MCQ-extractor
I’ve created a full Streamlit app that:

Lets you upload a PDF of MCQ questions,

Uses pytesseract + pdf2image to extract text,

Detects options and correct answers (✓ check mark),

Formats questions in a clean way,

Lists all answers at the end in grouped rows,

And provides a download button for the .txt output.
